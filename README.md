# Auto Generated 3d World
This is suppose to be a project where new 3D terrain is automatically generted, also you can modify it live as well.

## Requirements
Scipy
numpy
bpy

## Algorithm
### Step 1 (Done)
Random 3D Numpy array to represent how our terrain will look like.

### Step 2 (Done)
Use **Marching Cube Algorithm** to convert numpy array to 3d Mesh.
Save 3d Mesh as **.OBJ**

### Step 3 (Done)
UV unwrap using Blender python to allow texture on 3D Terrian

### Apply Random Texture (In Progress)
Working on finding algorithm to apply random but realistic texture on 3D Terrain.
